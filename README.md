## II. Abstract

This course is designed to provide a fundamental understanding of the Python programming language. It is intended for students with little or no programming experience who are interested in learning Python for data analysis, scientific computing, web development, or any other application. The course will cover the basics of Python syntax and semantics, as well as more advanced concepts such as object-oriented programming and functional programming.

## III. Presentation

This course is intended for college students interested in learning Python for a variety of applications, including data analysis, scientific computing, and web development. It is also suitable for professionals who want to learn Python as a tool for their work.

## IV. Learning Outcomes

1.	Learn how to use GitHub and potentially create your Academic/Tech website.
2.	Understand basic programming concepts such as variables, functions, loops, and conditionals.
3.	Write simple Python programs to solve problems
4.	Understand and use Python data types, including lists, dictionaries, and tuples
5.	Use Python libraries and modules to perform tasks like data analysis and scientific computing
6.	Understand and apply object-oriented and functional programming concepts in Python
7.	Use Python to Interact with Web APIs and Scrape Web Pages

## V. Methodology

Classes will be given synchronously via Zoom. While exploring the use of Python for data analysis, the use of databases for the social sciences will be emphasized.

## VI. Evaluation

The evaluation consists of a final work at the end of the course.

| Nº | Type of evaluation | Weighting on Final Grade |
|:-------------------|---| ---|
| 8 | Weekly evaluations | 80% |
| 1 | Final project | 20%|
