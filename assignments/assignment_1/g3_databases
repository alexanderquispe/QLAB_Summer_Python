b. Information: An Index at a county level (county codes) about human deprivation in 6 dimensions: standard of living, education, health, economic security,
   housing quality, and neighborhood quality, from years 2010 to 2019. This an alternative, more comprehensive way of estimating poverty.
c. Interest: I would like to observe the evolution of this indicator across time, and even be able to regroup the cases according to other characteristics,
   like state or geographic zone.

   and projections of economic developments at the global level, in major country groups in many individual countries.
c. Interest: I would like to work with macroeconomic indicators, to be able to analyze the series and explain their behavior over time.

3. Alexander Du-Bois
a. Database: Climate Change Knowledge Portal (CCKP), World Bank Group
b. Information: This databank contains information about current global climate and the future changes or vulnerabilities it may have. It contains data at a global, national and subnational level, and on diferent sectoral impacts used for predictability.
c. Interest: I am really interested in the evolution of climate change across the years in countries with different development stages, and would like to compare their policies and their impact with this data, to conclude wether their behavoir should be replicated, or if other solutions for global warming need to be taken into account.
