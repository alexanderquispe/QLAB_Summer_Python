#### Database 1

b. Information: Annual data base and ranking of 178 countries according to the type of pressures they face and their repercussions in terms of the levels of fragility. This index is based on Fund for Peace's proprietary conflict assessment system, an analytical approach and a social science methodology.

Finally, the scores obtained are distributed for each country based on twelve indicators that are the result of years of social experience and scientific research.
