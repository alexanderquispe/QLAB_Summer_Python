Databases proposal and description:

Ximena Pinillos:
a. Database: Environmental Database (WTO)

Sebastian Torres: 

Database 1
a. Database: Fragile State Index (FSI).

b. Information: Annual data base and ranking of 178 countries according to the type of pressures they face and their repercussions in terms of the levels of fragility. This index is based on Fund for Peace's proprietary conflict assessment system, an analytical approach and a social science methodology. In this sense, it is based on three main data streams: quantitative, qualitative and expert validation. Finally, the scores obtained are distributed for each country based on twelve indicators that are the result of years of social experience and scientific research.

c. Interest:  I would like to know how are countries organized according to the State Fragility Index. Intending that, I would like to propose a hierarchical cluster analysis in order to group those countries according to the FSI indicators.

Database 2
a. Database: The V-Dem Dataset. 

b. Information: Annual data about the quality of different governments and their respective political regimes. The V-Dem Project include information on hundreds of indicator variables describing all aspects of government, especially on the quality of democracy, inclusivity, and other political and economic indicators. 

c. Interest:  I would like to know how much the social and economic indicators and quality vary between countries depending on their political regime. In particular, Freedom of expression, the rule of law and control of corruption.
