a. Database: International Investment Position Statistics (IMF DATA)
b. Information: This daata is a statistical statement that shows at a point in time the value of financial assets of residens of an economy
that are claims on nonresidents or are gold bullion held as reserve assets, and the liabilities of residents of an economy to nonresidents.
The difference between the assets and liabilities is the net position in the IIP and represents either a net claim on or a net liability to
the rest of the world.  
c. Interest: It's interesting to study further how people's geographic position and the relationship between their country and other can
affect their investments. This data shows the distribution of investments in each country, such as direct investment, portfolio investment, 
reserve assets, among others.

a. Database: Young Lives
b. Information: Young Lives is a unique longitudinal study of poverty and inequality that has been following the lives of 12,000 children 
in Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana), Peru and Vietnam since 2001. 
c. Interest: I want to take advantage of this longitudinal survey to study how various factors like malnutrition, poverty and indicators of 
child care affect cognitive and socio-emotional development over the survey's multiple time rounds.

a. Database: ENDES
b. Information: The ENDES (National Survey of Demographic and Family´s Health), is a comprehensive survey conducted by the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics (INEI) in Peru. 
This survey aims to gather vital information about household living conditions, demographics, education, employment, and health. It is a key source of data for understanding the socio-economic landscape, poverty rates, and other critical indicators at the household level. 
ENDES is conducted annually, providing a rich and dynamic dataset that captures the evolving realities of Peruvian households over time.
ENDES (National Survey of Household Living Conditions and Poverty)
c. Interest: As an economist, I am particularly drawn to the ENDES database due to its robust nature and the depth of economic and social insights it offers. 
The survey's broad coverage allows for the exploration of various economic phenomena, such as income distribution, employment patterns, and poverty dynamics. 
The longitudinal aspect of ENDES is especially valuable, providing the opportunity to analyze trends and patterns that can inform evidence-based policy recommendations. Working with the ENDES dataset aligns with my professional interest in contributing to research and policy discussions aimed at enhancing socio-economic well-being. 
The comprehensive nature of ENDES makes it an indispensable resource for any economist seeking a nuanced understanding of household dynamics, economic disparities, and the effectiveness of social programs in Peru.
